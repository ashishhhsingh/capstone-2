<p class="about-para">
    Hello! I’m Ashish Singh, a passionate IT engineering student with a keen interest in technology, coding, and continuous learning.
    Alongside my academic journey, I enjoy playing sports and exploring new places, which keeps me energetic and motivated.
    I'm always curious about how things work behind the scenes — from websites to apps — and that curiosity drives me to learn more every day.
    I aim to become a skilled and professional developer, and I’m excited to see where this path takes me.
    One quote I truly believe in and often remind myself of is:
    “Keep learning, keep building — your potential is unlimited 🚀”.<br>
    It inspires me to stay consistent, keep improving, and embrace every opportunity to grow as a developer.
